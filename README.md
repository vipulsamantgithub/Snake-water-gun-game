# Snake-water-gun-game (Python Implementation)
This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic Snake-Water-Gun game, similar to Rock-Paper-Scissors. The game allows a user to play against the computer, where the first player to win 3 rounds emerges victorious. Key features include:

Game Logic: The game logic determines the winner based on user and computer choices:
Snake beats Water
Water beats Gun
Gun beats Snake
Round Tracking: The program keeps track of the number of rounds played and announces the winner after either the user or the computer wins 3 rounds.
Error Handling: Basic validation checks ensure smooth gameplay and handle incorrect inputs.
User Feedback: Provides real-time feedback to the user after each round, displaying results and updating the score.
Feel free to explore, test, and extend the functionality. This project demonstrates conditional logic, loops, and user interaction in Python
